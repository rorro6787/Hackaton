        over the years. These projects allow me to learn by doing, experimenting, and putting my skills into practice.

              The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and large language models (LLMs) to identify and
              flag potentially harmful email content with high accuracy. The model can identify non-desired e-mails, scam emails,
              fake giveaways, fake hacking emails, potentially harmful URLs, and more."
